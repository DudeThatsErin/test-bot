This is a bot that I created and decided to make it open-source. I get assistance from my awesome discord server when it comes to updates and fixing bugs.

## Current To Do List
- Get ++thanks system working (gives 10 points for each thanks and has a leaderboard to show who has the most thanks... shows who is the most helpful)
- Get ModMail System working. This is a lot more than just one command so it will take a while.
- Make sure all commands show `++` as the prefix and not `s.` for my Sakura Moon bot.

## Contributions
I love getting contributions. All you have to do is join the [r/CodingHelp Discord Server](https://codinghelp.site/discord) and you can make suggestions and help contribute to the bots success!
